## Short description

### What's the problem?

Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. Around the world, nine out of 10 people breathe unhealthy air. Air pollution is now the biggest environmental risk for early death, responsible for more than 6 million premature deaths each year from heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and respiratory diseases. Thatâ€™s more than the deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Research suggests that long term exposure to some pollutants increases the risk of emphysema more than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. And recent studies show air pollution can impact mental health, worker productivity and even stock market performance.

### How can technology help?

Technology will help us to analyse and determine the problem factors and provide solutions to combat them. Some of these are - Automotives, Air Purification, Smog Free Towers, Artificial Trees, Air Purifiers etc.

### The idea
The idea is to use IoT integration to pull the air quality index through connecting devices and innovation by integrating technologies to create a healthier society for tomorrow.

## The architecture


## Long description


## Project roadmap

- The main objective of this project is to determine the air pollution depending on the air quality index for any geographical location.

- After identifying the air pollution for particular location, we can state remedies to reduce the same.

- Identifying greeneries of any geographical locations and thus determining requirement of plantation of trees.
