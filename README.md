## Short description

### What's the problem?

Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. Around the world, nine out of 10 people breathe unhealthy air. Air pollution is now the biggest environmental risk for early death, responsible for more than 6 million premature deaths each year from heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and respiratory diseases. That’s more than the deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Research suggests that long term exposure to some pollutants increases the risk of emphysema more than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. And recent studies show air pollution can impact mental health, worker productivity and even stock market performance.

### How can technology help?

Technology will help us to analyse and determine the problem factors and provide solutions to combat them. Some of these are - Automotives, Air Purification, Smog Free Towers, Artificial Trees, Air Purifiers etc.

### The idea
The idea is to use IoT integration to pull the air quality index through connecting devices and innovation by integrating technologies to create a healthier society for tomorrow.

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](./images/roadmap.png)

- The main objective of this project is to determine the air pollution depending on the air quality index for any geographical location.  

- After identifying the air pollution for particular location, we can state remedies to reduce the same.

- Identifying greeneries of any geographical locations and thus determining requirement of plantation of trees.
