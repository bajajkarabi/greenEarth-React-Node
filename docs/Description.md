# Description

These project has two sections.

## Section 1

We have cognitive devices installed in various locations. Using the help of Google Maps we can locate the regions. Cloud service functions are used to trigger these cognitive devices and sense the AQI metrics. Once the data is obtained, it will get stored into Cloud storage. Our application will then read the current data from storage and display each metrics details in a graphical manner.


## Section 2

For future analysis we will get the past data from storage and provide an analysis to the users on what has been the air quality in the past and how much it has deteriorated. This again will be a graphical representation.
